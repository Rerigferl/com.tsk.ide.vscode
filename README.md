## Features

### Project SDK Support

This package offers comprehensive project SDK support based on .Net standards. By leveraging this support, you can utilize the latest C# features and language enhancements within your Unity projects, subject to Unity's compatibility.

### Organized .csproj Files

To enhance project structure and maintain cleanliness, the `com.tsk.ide.vscode` package facilitates the automatic separation of `.csproj` files into individual folders. These folders are consolidated within a main directory named "CSProjFolders." This organization ensures a more streamlined and organized project structure, contributing to improved clarity and ease of navigation.

### Successful Dotnet Build

The `com.tsk.ide.vscode` package ensures a seamless build process by guaranteeing successful execution of the `dotnet build` command. This means that your project can be compiled and built without any issues, ensuring a smooth development experience.

### Microsoft.Unity.Analyzers Integration [![NuGet](https://img.shields.io/nuget/v/Microsoft.Unity.Analyzers.svg)](https://nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.Unity.Analyzers)

In addition to its core features, this package includes seamless integration with the Microsoft.Unity.Analyzers library. This integration provides you with access to a wide range of code analysis and validation tools specifically designed for Unity projects. With the support of these analyzers, you can enhance code quality, identify potential issues, and adhere to best practices, ultimately improving the overall robustness and maintainability of your Unity projects.

### Streamlined Configuration Setup and Customization

The com.tsk.ide.vscode package presents a proficient solution designed for streamlined integration of Visual Studio Code with Unity. This package significantly simplifies the setup process by generating essential configuration files, namely omnisharp.json and .editorconfig. This not only conserves valuable time but also boosts your efficiency by minimizing the potential for setup errors.

To utilize this feature, navigate to `Preferences > External Tools > Generate config files for:` and select the appropriate options to create the configuration files. After this, merely click on the `Regenerate` button.

Beyond simplifying setup, the com.tsk.ide.vscode package introduces a dedicated configuration section within External Tools. This component provides unprecedented control over the settings files generated, enabling manual customization in accordance with individual preferences and unique project requirements. This level of flexibility allows you to customize your development environment for the best possible productivity and outcome.

### Enable the Full Potential of Modern .NET

By eliminating the need to disable the use of ModernNet, you can effortlessly access the complete range of modern .NET features within your Unity projects. This seamless integration unlocks a multitude of benefits, including enhanced performance and improved stability, empowering you to optimize your projects like never before.

## Prerequisites

1. Install both the .Net 7 and .Net 6 SDKs - <https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download>
2. Crossroad choice between Omnisharp (Unsupported) or C# Devkit (Preview but supported by Microsoft)
    - Omnisharp: Install the [C# extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-dotnettools.csharp) from the VS Code Marketplace.
    - C# Devkit: Install the [C# Dev Kit extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-dotnettools.csdevkit) from the VS Code Marketplace.

### Windows Only

-   Logout or restart Windows to allow changes to `%PATH%` to take effect.
-   The C# extension no longer ships with Microsoft Build Tools, so they must be installed manually.
    -   Download the [Build Tools for Visual Studio 2022](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/#build-tools-for-visual-studio-2022).
    -   Install the .NET desktop build tools workload. No other components are required.

### MacOS Only

-   To avoid seeing "Some projects have trouble loading. Please review the output for more details", make sure to install the latest stable [Mono](https://www.mono-project.com/download/) release.
-   If you aren't using C# Devkit, do the following:
    1. In your Visual Studio Code (VS Code) user settings, ensure that the configuration `"omnisharp.useModernNet":` is set to `false`. This configuration must be in place to prevent VS Code from utilizing the Mono version included in the official C# extension (specifically, version 6.0.X as of the latest release).
    2. Upon installing the latest version of Mono directly, set the following configuration value:
       `"omnisharp.monoPath": "/Library/Frameworks/Mono.framework/Versions/Current"` - Ensure you replace the provided path with the location where you installed Mono. By doing so, VS Code will strictly utilize the newly installed version of Mono for all operations.
